# Solving exercises

You may want to check out [this pdf file](./teoria-dos-conjuntos1.pdf) in order to read more about set theory and the needed properties to perform operations between them.

The __bold text__ will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using formulas. The *italic text* will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using the [Venn diagram](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/venn-diagrams.html), in this case the [lucid chart tool](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/pt/exemplos/diagrama-de-venn-online) will be used to plot the diagrams.

### Question No. 11

A test was made up of two problems. 300 students hit only one, 260 hit the second, 100 students hit both and 210 missed the first. How many students took the test?

![Question No. 11 diagram](./images/QuestionNo11.png)

__Answer:__  
```
450 students took the test.
```

### Question No. 12

According to the theory, a set with m elements has exactly 2ᵐ subsets. Using this reasoning, determine the number of elements in set A, knowing that:

1. B is a set of three elements;  
2. A ∩ B is empty;  
3. The number of subsets of A ∪ B is 32.  

__Answer:__  
```
1 => P(B) = 2³ => 𝟾̲
2 => A ∩ B = {∅}
3 => A ∪ B = P(32) => A ∪ 3 = 2⁵ => 2 ∪ 3 = 5

A is a set of two elements.
```
