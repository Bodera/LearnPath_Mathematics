# Solving exercises

You may want to check out [this pdf file](./teoria-dos-conjuntos1.pdf) in order to read more about set theory and the needed properties to perform operations between them.

The __bold text__ will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using formulas. The *italic text* will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using the [Venn diagram](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/venn-diagrams.html), in this case the [lucid chart tool](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/pt/exemplos/diagrama-de-venn-online) will be used to plot the diagrams.

### Question No. 12

According to the theory, a set with m elements has exactly 2ᵐ subsets. Using this reasoning, determine the number of elements in set A, knowing that:

1. B is a set of three elements;  
2. A ∩ B is empty;  
3. The number of subsets of A ∪ B is 32.  

__Answer:__  

```txt
1 => P(B) = 2³ => 8
2 => A ∩ B = {∅}
3 => A ∪ B = P(32) => A ∪ 3 = 2⁵ => 2 ∪ 3 = 5

A is a set of two elements.
```

### Question No. 13

A publisher is studying the possibility of launching the publications HELENA, SENHORA and A MORENINHA again.

It is questioned:

![Question No. 13 diagram](./images/set-theory/QuestionNo13.png)

a) How many people read only one of the three works?  

```txt
(H ∪ M ∪ S)
= 270 + 120 + 70
= 460
```

b) How many people have not read any of the three works?  

```txt
Complementary of (H ∪ M ∪ S)
= 130
```

c) How many people read two or more works?  

```txt
(H ∩ S) + (M ∩ S) + (H ∩ M) + (H ∩ S ∩ M)
= 80 + 130 + 180 + 20
= 410
