# Solving exercises

You may want to check out [this pdf file](./teoria-dos-conjuntos1.pdf) in order to read more about set theory and the needed properties to perform operations between them.

The __bold text__ will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using formulas. The *italic text* will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using the [Venn diagram](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/venn-diagrams.html), in this case the [lucid chart tool](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/pt/exemplos/diagrama-de-venn-online) will be used to plot the diagrams.

### Question No. 12

According to the theory, a set with m elements has exactly 2ᵐ subsets. Using this reasoning, determine the number of elements in set A, knowing that:

1. B is a set of three elements;  
2. A ∩ B is empty;  
3. The number of subsets of A ∪ B is 32.  

__Answer:__  
```
1 => P(B) = 2³ => 8
2 => A ∩ B = {∅}
3 => A ∪ B = P(32) => A ∪ 3 = 2⁵ => 2 ∪ 3 = 5

A is a set of two elements.
```

### Question No. 13

A publisher is studying the possibility of launching the publications HELENA, SENHORA and A MORENINHA again.

It is questioned:

![Question No. 13 diagram](./images/QuestionNo13.png)

a) How many people read only one of the three works?  
```
(H ∪ M ∪ S)
= 270 + 120 + 70
= 460
```
b) How many people have not read any of the three works?  
```
Complementary of (H ∪ M ∪ S)
= 130
```
c) How many people read two or more works?  
```
(H ∩ S) + (M ∩ S) + (H ∩ M) + (H ∩ S ∩ M)
= 80 + 130 + 180 + 20
= 410
```

It is questioned:

![Question No. 14 diagram](./images/QuestionNo14.png)

a) How many play football and do not play volleyball?  
```
F + (B ∩ F)
= 25 + 11
= 36

The number of elements in the set A ⋂ B is?

a) 9  
b) 10  
c) 11  
d) 12  

`Hint`
```
A ⋂ B = {16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24}

A total of 9 elements.
```

__Answer__:

Letter __A__ is correct.

### Question No. 25

Consider the following sets of natural numbers:

i. A = {x ∈ ℕ | 1 ≤ x ≤ 20}
ii. B = {x ∈ ℕ | 17 < x ≤ 25}

The number of subsets in A ⋂ B is equal to:

a) 3  
b) 4  
c) 6  
d) 8  

`Hint`
```
A ⋂ B has a total of 3 elements.
A ⋂ B = {18, 19, 20}
The total subsets that we can form from A ⋂ B is = 2³
2 ^ 3 = 8

a subset without elements: {∅}
a subset with a single element: {18}; {19}; {20}
a subset with two elements: {18, 19}; {18, 20}; {19, 20}
a subset with three elements: {18, 19, 20}
```

__Answer__:

Letter __D__ is correct.

### Question No. 26

Let A be a set with 8 elements. The number of subsets in A is?

a) 8  
b) 256  
c) 6  
d) 128  

`Hint`
```
A has a total of 8 elements.
A = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}
The total subsets that we can form from A = 2⁸
2 ^ 8 = 256

a subset without elements: {∅}
a subset with a single element: {...}
a subset with two elements: {...}
a subset with three elements: {...}
a subset with four elements: {...}
a subset with five elements: {...}
a subset with six elements: {...}
a subset with seven elements: {...}
a subset with eight elements: {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}

We've already proved it.
```

__Answer__:

Letter __B__ is correct.

### Question No. 27

Given the set E = {1, 2, 4, 8}, does it have how many subsets?

a) 8  
b) 16  
c) 32  
d) 64  

`Hint`
```
E has a total of 4 elements.
The total subsets that we can form from A = 2⁴
2 ^ 4 = 16

a subset without elements: {∅}
a subset with a single element: {...}
a subset with two elements: {...}
a subset with three elements: {...}
a subset with four elements: {1, 2, 3, 4}

We've already proved it.
```

__Answers__:

Letter __B__ is correct.

### Question No. 28

What is the set of parts of the empty set?

a) ∅  
b) {∅}  
c) {∅, {∅}}  
d) {{∅}}  

`Hint`
```
∅ = {∅}
∅ has a total of 0 elements.
The total subsets that we can form from ∅ = 2⁰
2 ^ 0 = 1

a subset without elements: {∅}
```

__Answer__:

Letter __B__ is correct.

### Question No. 29

What is the set of parts of the set {∅}?

a) ∅  
b) {∅}  
c) {∅, {∅}}  
d) {{∅}}  

`Hint`
```
{∅} = {∅, {∅}}
{∅} has a total of 1 elements.
The total subsets that we can form from {∅} = 2¹
2 ^ 1 = 2

a subset without elements: {∅}
a subset with a single elements: {{∅}}
```

__Answer__:

Letter __C__ is correct.
