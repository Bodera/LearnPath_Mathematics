## Basic operations with numerical fractions

### Question No. 1

The result of the following numeric expression is:

```
⁵⁄₂ - ⁷⁄₄ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃ = ?⁄?
```

#### Solution for question no. 1

```
⁵⁄₂ - ⁷⁄₄ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃ = ?⁄?
= (²⁰⁻¹⁴⁄₈) - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁶⁄₈ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃
= ³⁄₄ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃
= (¹⁸⁻⁴⁴⁄₂₄) + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁻²⁶⁄₂₄ + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁻¹³⁄₁₂ + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁻³⁹⁺⁹⁶⁄₃₆
= ⁵⁷⁄₃₆
= ¹⁹⁄₁₂
```

### Question No. 2

The result of the following numeric expression is:

```
(⁷⁄₃ ÷ ⁴⁄₆) * ⁷⁄₃
```

#### Solution for question no. 2

```
(⁷⁄₃ ÷ ⁴⁄₆) * ⁷⁄₃
= (⁷⁄₃ * ⁶⁄₄) * ⁷⁄₃
= ⁴²⁄₁₂ * ⁷⁄₃
= ⁷⁄₂ * ⁷⁄₃
= ⁴⁹⁄₆
```

### Question No. 3

A math test contains 150 questions. One student got 7/10 of the questions right. How many questions did this student get right?

#### Solution for question no. 3

```
⁷⁄₁₀ * ¹⁵⁰⁄₁
= ¹⁰⁵⁰⁄₁₀
= 105
```

### Question No. 4

If ³⁄₇ of what I have is R$ 195.00, how much is ⁴⁄₅ of what I have?

#### Solution for question no. 4

```
³⁄₇ = 195.00

⁴⁄₇ = (195.00 ÷ 3) * 4
⁴⁄₇ = 65 * 4
⁴⁄₇ = 260

³⁄₇ + ⁴⁄₇ = ⁷⁄₇ ∴ 195.00 + 260 = 455.00

I've R$ 455.00 in total.

⁴⁄₅ = (455 ÷ 5) * 4
⁴⁄₅ = 91 * 4
⁴⁄₅ = 364

Therefore ⁴⁄₅ of what I've is R$ 364.00
```

### Question No. 5

Roberto and Marina gathered money to buy a videogame. Roberto paid 5/8 of the price and Marina contributed with R$ 45.00. How much did the videogame cost?

#### Solution for question no. 5

```
³⁄₈ = 45.00

⁵⁄₈ = (45 ÷ 3) * 5
⁵⁄₈ = 15 * 5
⁵⁄₈ = 75

³⁄₈ + ⁵⁄₈ = ⁸⁄₈ ∴ 45.00 + 75 = 120.00

Roberto paid R$ 75.00 and Marina R$ 45.00. The total cost of the videogame was R$ 120.00
```
