## Basic operations with numerical fractions

### Question No. 1

The result of the following numeric expression is:

```
⁵⁄₂ - ⁷⁄₄ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃ = ?⁄?
```

#### Solution for question no. 1

```
⁵⁄₂ - ⁷⁄₄ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃ = ?⁄?
= (²⁰⁻¹⁴⁄₈) - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁶⁄₈ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃
= ³⁄₄ - ¹¹⁄₆ + ⁸⁄₃
= (¹⁸⁻⁴⁴⁄₂₄) + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁻²⁶⁄₂₄ + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁻¹³⁄₁₂ + ⁸⁄₃
= ⁻³⁹⁺⁹⁶⁄₃₆
= ⁵⁷⁄₃₆
= ¹⁹⁄₁₂
```
