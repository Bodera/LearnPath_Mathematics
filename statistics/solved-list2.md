## Central Trend Measures

In exercises 1-10, do the following:

(a) Determine the mean, median and mode of the data, if possible. If this is not possible, explain why the measure of central tendency could not be determined.  
(b) What is the central trend measure that best represents the data? Explain your reasoning.

### Question No. 1

```
4.0  4.8  4.8  4.8  4.8  5.1  8.6
```

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 1

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```
4.0  4.8  4.8  4.8  4.8  5.1  8.6
```

__2º step__ - Calculate the arithmetic mean of the data set by applying the formula:

```
x̅ = (1/n) * (x₁ + ... + xₙ)
n: total of values in the data set
xₙ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, the arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```
x̅ = (1/7) * (4.0 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 5.1 + 8.6)
