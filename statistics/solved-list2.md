## Central Trend Measures

In exercises 1-10, do the following:

(a) Determine the mean, median and mode of the data, if possible. If this is not possible, explain why the measure of central tendency could not be determined.  
(b) What is the central trend measure that best represents the data? Explain your reasoning.

### Question No. 1

The time in seconds that a sample of seven sports cars takes to go from zero to 60 miles per hour:

```
4.0  4.8  4.8  4.8  4.8  5.1  8.6
```

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 1

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```
4.0  4.8  4.8  4.8  4.8  5.1  8.6
```

__2º step__ - Calculate the arithmetic mean of the data set by applying the formula:

```
x̅ = (1/n) * (x₁ + ... + xₙ)
n: total of values in the data set
xₙ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```
x̅ = (1/7) * (4.0 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 5.1 + 8.6)
x̅ = 0.1428 * 36.9
x̅ = 5.27
```

__3º step__ - Now let's answer the questions.

Average: __5.27__  
Median: __4.8__  
Mode: __4.8__  

The central trend measure that best represents the data is the __median__, since there is an outlier in the sample (8.6).

```
147  154  171  173  181  184  188  203  216  229
```

__2º step__ - Calculate the arithmetic mean of the data set by applying the formula:

```
x̅ = (1/n) * (x₁ + ... + xₙ)
n: total of values in the data set
xₙ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```
x̅ = (1/10) * (147 + 154 + 171 + 173 + 181 + 184 + 188 + 203 + 216 + 229)
x̅ = 0.1 * 1846
x̅ = 184.6
```

__3º step__ - Now let's answer the questions.

Average: __184.6__  
Median: __182.5__ (the sum of the 2 records in the middle divided by 2)  
Mode: __There is none__ (*Amodal*)  

The central trend measure that best represents the data is the __average__, since there isn't an outlier in the sample.  

### Question No. 3

```

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 3

__1º step__ - Let's answer the questions.

Average: __Inconclusive__  
Median: __Inconclusive__  
Mode: __National__  

The central trend measure that best represents the data is the __mode__, since there others measures were inconclusives.

```
x̅ = (1/n) * (x₁ + ... + xₙ)
n: total of values in the data set
xₙ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```
x̅ = (1/13) * (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9)
x̅ = 0.077 * 81
x̅ = 6.237
```

__3º step__ - Now let's answer the questions.

knowing this, arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```
x̅ = (1/10) * (14 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 26)
x̅ = 0.1 * 196
x̅ = 19.6
```

__3º step__ - Now let's answer the questions.

Average: __19.6__  
Median: __19.5__ (the sum of the 2 records in the middle divided by 2)  
Mode: __19__ and __20__ (*Bimodal*)  

The central trend measure that best represents the data is the __average__, since there isn't an outlier in the sample.
