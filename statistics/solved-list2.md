In exercises 1-10, do the following:

(a) Determine the mean, median and mode of the data, if possible. If this is not possible, explain why the measure of central tendency could not be determined.  
(b) What is the central trend measure that best represents the data? Explain your reasoning.

### Question No. 1

The time in seconds that a sample of seven sports cars takes to go from zero to 60 miles per hour:

```txt
4.0  4.8  4.8  4.8  4.8  5.1  8.6
```

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 1

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```txt
4.0  4.8  4.8  4.8  4.8  5.1  8.6
```

__2º step__ - Calculate the arithmetic mean of the data set by applying the formula:

```txt
x̅ = (1/n) * (x₁ + ... + xₙ)
n: total of values in the data set
xₙ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, the arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```txt
x̅ = (1/7) * (4.0 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 5.1 + 8.6)
x̅ = 0.1428 * 36.9
x̅ = 5.27
```

__3º step__ - Now let's answer the questions.

Average: __5.27__  
Median: __4.8__  
Mode: __4.8__  

The central trend measure that best represents the data is the __median__, since there is an outlier in the sample (8.6).

__2º step__ - Answer the question.

The harmonic average of the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 is __1.92__.

### Question No. 22

Suppose that on a given trip, a car develops __two__ distinct speeds, during half the journey it maintained a speed of 50km/h and during the remaining half it's speed was 60km/h. Determine the average vehicle speed on the route.

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 22

__1º step__ - Calculate the harmonic mean.

![Harmonic mean formula](https://www.thecalculator.co/includes/forms/assets/img/Harmonic%20Mean%20Formula.jpg)

knowing this, the harmonic mean can now be calculate:

          11
         —————
          300

x̅ Harm = 54.54...
```

__2º step__ - Answer the question.

The average speed of the vehicle on this trip was __54.54km/h__.

### Question No. 23

A group of tourists travels by boat at an average speed of 18km/h and then returns by helicopter, following the same route, at an average speed of 72km/h. What is the average speed of the entire route?

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 23

__1º step__ - Calculate the harmonic mean.

![Harmonic mean formula](https://www.thecalculator.co/includes/forms/assets/img/Harmonic%20Mean%20Formula.jpg)

knowing this, the harmonic mean can now be calculate:

```txt
Because there are 2 routes:

x̅ Harm =
               2
      ——————————————————
          1        1
        —————— + ——————
          18       72

x̅ Harm =
           2
        ————————
           90
         ——————
          1296

x̅ Harm = 28.8
```

__2º step__ - Answer the question.

The average speed in the entire route was __28.8km/h__.

### Question No. 24

A water truck fills a pool in 20 minutes while another truck takes half an hour to do the same job. How long will the water trucks take together?

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 24

__1º step__ - Calculate the harmonic mean.

![Harmonic mean formula](https://www.thecalculator.co/includes/forms/assets/img/Harmonic%20Mean%20Formula.jpg)

knowing this, the harmonic mean can now be calculate:

```txt
Because it is only one pool:

x̅ Harm =
               1
      ——————————————————
          1        1
        —————— + ——————
          20       30

x̅ Harm =
           1
        ————————
           5
         ——————
           60

x̅ Harm = 12
```

__2º step__ - Answer the question.

Together the water trucks will take __12__ minutes to fill the pool.
