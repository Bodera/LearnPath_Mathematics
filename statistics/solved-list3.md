## Variations measures


### Question No. 1

Obtain the total amplitude, average, variance and standart deviation for the two data sets below:

```
Dataset 1:  11   10   8   4   6   7   11   6   11   7

Dataset 2:  15   8   12   5   19   14   8   6   13
```

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 1

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```
Dataset 1:  4   6   6   7   7   8   10   11   11   11  

Dataset 2:  5   6   8   8   12   13   14   15   19
```

__2º step__ - Then calculate the total amplitude of each data set by subtracting the highest value from the lowest value.

```
Dataset 1:  (11) - (4)
            = 7 value of total amplitude

Dataset 2:  (19) - (5)
            = 14 value of total amplitude
```

__3º step__ - Calculate the arithmetic mean of each data set by applying the formula:

```
x̅ = (1/n) * (x₁ + ... + xₙ)
n: total of values in the data set
xₙ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```
Dataset 1:  (1 / 10) * (4 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 11)
            = 0.1 * 81
            = 8.1 value of arithmetic mean

Dataset 2:  (1 / 9) * (5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 19)
            = 0.111... * 100
            = 11.111... value of arithmetic mean
```

__4º step__ - Calculate the standart deviation of each data set by applying the formula:

```
s = √((1/(n-1)) * (xᵢ - x̅)²)
x̅: arithmetic average of data set
n: total of values in the data set
xᵢ: each individual value in the data set
```

knowing this, standart deviation can now be calculate:

```
Dataset 1:  √((1/(10-1)) * ((4 - 8.1)² + (6 - 8.1)² + (6 - 8.1)² + (7 - 8.1)² + (7 - 8.1)² +
                            (8 - 8.1)² + (10 - 8.1)² + (11 - 8.1)² + (11 - 8.1)² + (11 - 8.1)²))
            = √((1/9) * (16.81 + 4.41 + 4.41 + 1.21 + 1.21 + 0.01 + 3.61 + 8.41 + 8.41 + 8.41))
            = √(0.111... * 56.9)
            = √(6.3222...)
            = 2.514402955 value of standart deviation

Dataset 2:  √((1/(9-1)) * ((5 - 11.111...)² + (6 - 11.111...)² + (8 - 11.111...)² +

                           (14 - 11.111...)² + (15 - 11.111...)² + (19 - 11.111...)²))
            = √((1/8) * (37.34567765 + 26.12345565 + 9.679011654 + 9.679011654 + 0.7901236543 +
                         3.567901654 + 8.345679654 + 15.12345765 + 62.23456965))
            = √(0.125 * 172.8888889)
            = √(21.6111...)
            = 4.648775227 value of standart deviation
```

__5º step__ - Calculate the variance of each data set by applying the formula:

```
s²
s: standart deviation
```

knowing this, standart deviation can now be calculate:

```
Dataset 1:  (2.514402955)²
            = 6.3222... value of variance

Dataset 2:  (4.648775227)²
            = 21.6111... value of variance
```
