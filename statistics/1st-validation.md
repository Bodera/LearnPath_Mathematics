### Question No. 7

The final average in our statistics discipline is calculated using the weighted average. Thus, there are two tests (P1 and P2) with weights 4 and 6, respectively, and two lists (L1 and L2) with equal weights. In addition, the weighted average of the tests has a weight of 8 and the average of the lists has a weight of 2. The table below shows the marks obtained by a student during a semester. So, the final average of this student will be?

| P1  | P2  | L1  | L2  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 4.5 | 5.8 | 6.2 | 7.3 |

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 7

__1st step__: Calculate the grade average.

```txt
exams score
= ((4.5 * 4 + 5.8 * 6) ÷ 10) * 8
= 42.24

lists score
= ((6.2 + 7.3) ÷ 2) * 2
= 13.5

final average
= (42.24 + 13.5) ÷ 10
= 5.574
```

__2nd step__: Answer the question.

The final average of the the studen was `5.57`.

xₙ: each individual record in the sample
```

knowing this, the geometric mean can now be calculate:

```txt
x̅ Geom = ³√1.20 * 1.50 * 1.05

__2nd step__: Calculate the arithmetic mean for tabular data.

```txt
x̅ =
      ∑(fᵢ*x^ᵢ)
    ————————————
        ∑ fᵢ
fᵢ: relative frequency of xᵢ
x^ᵢ: midpoint of xᵢ
∑(fᵢ*x^ᵢ): summation of the product of fᵢ and x^ᵢ, for all instances of xᵢ
∑ fᵢ: summation of fᵢ, for all instances of xᵢ
```

knowing this, the arithmetic mean can now be calculate:

```txt
x̅ = 1325 ÷ 40
x̅ = 33.125
```

__3rd step__: Calculate the median for tabular data.

```txt
x~ = Lim inf + (h * ((Lx - Fant) ÷ fᵢ))

Lim inf: lower limit of the median class
h: amplitude of the median class (any lower limit subtracted from the immediately lower limit)
Lx: ⁿ⁄₂, where n is the sum of all relative frequencies in the data set
Fant: cumulative frequency before the median class
fᵢ: relative frequency of the median class
```

knowing this, the median can now be calculate:

```txt
median class: the class where the value of Lx is (check Fᵢ)
median class: 30 |--- 35

x~ = 30 + (5 * ((20 - 14) ÷ 9))
x~ = 30 + (5 * (6 ÷ 9))
x~ = 30 + 3.33333
x~ = 33.33333
```

__4th step__: Calculate the mode for tabular data.

```txt
Mo = Lim inf + h * (Δ₁ ÷ (Δ₁ + Δ₂))

Lim inf: lower limit of the modal class
h: amplitude of the modal class (any lower limit subtracted from the immediately lower limit)
Δ₁: relative frequency of the modal class subtracted from the relative frequency immediately preceding
Δ₂: relative frequency of the modal class subtracted from the relative frequency immediately afterwards
```

knowing this, the mode can now be calculate:

```txt
modal class: the class with higher frequency of samples
modal class: 35 |--- 40

Mo = 35 + 5 * (2 ÷ (2 + 7))
Mo = 35 + 5 * (2 ÷ 9)
Mo = 35 + 1.11111
Mo = 36.11111
```

__5th step__: Answer the questions.

Mean = __33.125__  
Median = __33.33__  
Mode = __36.11__
