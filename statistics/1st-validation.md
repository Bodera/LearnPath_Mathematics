### Question No. 1

The data below shows the number of accesses to a server made by 30 different clients in the period of one month. Considering a distribution table with 5 classes, select the alternative that represents the 4th row of that table.

```txt
30  41  39  38  33  35  31  36  37  32
32  38  26  29  32  41  28  31  45  30
45  35  40  30  31  40  37  33  28  36
```

#### Procedures for solution of question no. 1

__1st step__: Sort the data in ascending order.

```txt
26  28  28  29  30  30  30  31  31  31
32  32  32  33  33  35  35  36  36  37
37  38  38  39  40  40  41  41  45  45
```

__2nd step__: Calculate the amplitude of the dataset.

```txt
(higher value) - (smaller value) = amplitude
45 - 26 = 19
```

__3rd step__: Draft a frequency table.

|     *xᵢ*    | *fᵢ* | *% fᵢ* |
|:-----------:|:----:|:------:|
| 26 \|--- 30 |   4  |  13,33 |
| 30 \|--- 34 |  11  |  36,67 |
| 34 \|--- 38 |   6  |   20   |
| 38 \|--- 42 |   7  |  23,33 |
| 42 \|--- 46 |   2  |  6,67  |

__4th step__: Answer the question.

```txt
4th row is:

| 38 |--- 42 |  7  | 23,33 |
```
