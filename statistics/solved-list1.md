### Question No. 3

Akhiok is a small fishing village on the island of Kodiak  Alaska. The following census represents the stated age data for the entire population of the 77 inhabitants of Akhiok:

```
28  6  17  48  63  47  27  21  3  7  12
39  50  54  33  45  15  24  1  7  36  53
46  27  5  10  32  50  52  11  42  22  3
17  34  56  25  2  30  10  33  1  49  13
16  8  31  21  6  9  2  11  32  25  0
55  23  41  29  4  51  1  6  31  5  5
4  10  26  12  6  16  8  2  4  28  11
```

a) Build a frequency distribution using the ages of Akhiok inhabitants (dataset above). Use six classes.

b) Using the frequency distribution obtained in the previous exercise, determine the midpoint of the classes and the relative and cumulative frequencies for each class.

c) Using the frequency distribution obtained in the two previous exercises, construct a frequency histogram, frequency polygon and a cumulative frequency graph.

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 3

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```
0  1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  4  4
4  5  5  5  6  6  6  6  7  7  8
8  9  10  10  10  11  11  11  12  12  13
15  16  16  17  17  21  21  22  23  24  25
25  26  27  27  28  28  29  30  31  31  32
32  33  33  34  36  39  41  42  45  46  47
48  49  50  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  63
```

__2º step__ - To create a frequency distribution table, we need to find out the range for each class. The question tells us explicitly to use 6 classes.

```
77 = number of total records in the data set
6 = number of classes in the frequency distribution table
77 ÷ 6 = 12.8333...

However the highest record in the dataset is actually 63. So to better adjust the range let's make a different approach.

63 = highest record
6 = number of classes in the frequency distribution table
63 ÷ 6 = 10.5

The ideal interval between classes for the frequency distribution table is 11.
```

knowing this, the frequency distribution table can now be built:

| Midpoint (x^) |  Age (x) | Absolute frequency (f) | Cumulative frequency (F) |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|
|      5.5      |  0\|---11 |           27           |            27            |
|      16.5     | 11\|---22 |           13           |            40            |
|      27.5     | 22\|---33 |           16           |            56            |
|      38.5     | 33\|---44 |            7           |            63            |
|      49.5     | 44\|---55 |           11           |            74            |
|      60.5     | 55\|---66 |            3           |            77            |
