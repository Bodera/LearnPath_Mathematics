### Question No. 3

Akhiok is a small fishing village on the island of Kodiak  Alaska. The following census represents the stated age data for the entire population of the 77 inhabitants of Akhiok:

```txt
28  6  17  48  63  47  27  21  3  7  12
39  50  54  33  45  15  24  1  7  36  53
46  27  5  10  32  50  52  11  42  22  3
17  34  56  25  2  30  10  33  1  49  13
16  8  31  21  6  9  2  11  32  25  0
55  23  41  29  4  51  1  6  31  5  5
4  10  26  12  6  16  8  2  4  28  11
```

a) Build a frequency distribution using the ages of Akhiok inhabitants (dataset above). Use six classes.

b) Using the frequency distribution obtained in the previous exercise, determine the midpoint of the classes and the relative and cumulative frequencies for each class.

c) Using the frequency distribution obtained in the two previous exercises, construct a frequency histogram, frequency polygon and a cumulative frequency graph.

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 3

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```txt
0  1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  4  4
4  5  5  5  6  6  6  6  7  7  8
8  9  10  10  10  11  11  11  12  12  13
15  16  16  17  17  21  21  22  23  24  25
25  26  27  27  28  28  29  30  31  31  32
32  33  33  34  36  39  41  42  45  46  47
48  49  50  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  63
```

__2º step__ - To create a frequency distribution table, we need to find out the range for each class. The question tells us explicitly to use 6 classes.

```txt
77 = number of total records in the data set
6 = number of classes in the frequency distribution table
77 ÷ 6 = 12.8333...
```

However the highest record in the dataset is actually 63. So to better adjust the range let's make a different approach.

```txt
63 = highest record
6 = number of classes in the frequency distribution table
63 ÷ 6 = 10.5
```

The ideal interval between classes for the frequency distribution table is __11__.

knowing this, the frequency distribution table can now be built:

|    *x*    | *x^* | *fᵢ* | *% fᵢ* | *Fᵢ* | *% Fᵢ* |
|:---------:|:----:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:------:|
|  0\|---11 |  5.5 |  27  |  35.06 |  27  |  35.06 |
| 11\|---22 | 16.5 |  13  |  16.88 |  40  |  51.95 |
| 22\|---33 | 27.5 |  16  |  20.78 |  56  |  72.72 |
| 33\|---44 | 38.5 |   7  |   9.1  |  63  |  81.81 |
| 44\|---55 | 49.5 |  11  |  14.28 |  74  |  96.10 |
| 55\|---66 | 60.5 |   3  |   3.9  |  77  |   100  |

__3º step__ - Now that we've finished the table, we can plot the graphs.

### Question No. 4

A survey on the age, in years, of a freshman class at a college, revealed the following data:

```txt
18, 17, 18, 20, 21, 19, 20, 18, 17, 19
20, 18, 19, 18, 19, 21, 18, 19, 18, 18
19, 19, 21, 20, 17, 19, 19, 18, 18, 19
18, 21, 18, 19, 19, 20, 19, 18, 19, 20
18, 19, 19, 18, 20, 20, 18, 19, 18, 18
```

Your task is to build the convenient frequency distribution for this data and plot the data on a line graph.

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 4

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```txt
17, 17, 17, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18
18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18
18, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19
19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 21, 21
```

__2º step__ - To create a frequency distribution table, we need to find out the range for each class. The instruction left us free to choose the number of classes.

```txt
50 = number of total records in the data set
5 = number of distinct records
```

So for convenience each class will consist of __a single value__, without intervals.

knowing this, the frequency distribution table can now be built:

| Age (x) | Absolute frequency (f) | Cumulative frequency (F) | Relative frequency % (fr) | Cumulative frequency % |
|:-------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|    17   |            3           |             3            |             6             |            6           |
|    18   |           18           |            21            |             36            |           42           |
|    19   |           17           |            38            |             34            |           76           |
|    20   |            8           |            46            |             16            |           92           |
|    21   |            4           |            50            |             8             |           100          |
|   ###   |           50           |            ###           |            100%           |           ###          |

__3º step__ - Now that we've finished the table, we can plot the graph.

### Question No. 5

The data below represent the earnings of a stock exchange share in the last 50 months. Build the frequency distribution suitable for this data and sketch the frequency histogram of that distribution.

```txt
2.50, 2.00, 1.50, 1.00, 2.80, 3.00
4.50, 5.00, 5.20, 4.40, 1.20, 4.30
4.00, 4.15, 4.25, 2.33, 2.15, 1.36
3.20, 5.32, 4.15, 1.25, 2.59, 2.16
4.12, 5.23, 1.24, 1.00, 1.62, 2.00
2.56, 4.16, 4.26, 4.36, 5.89, 4.30
5.66, 3.33, 3.40, 2.69, 4.22, 4.89
5.69, 5.98, 5.00, 2.70, 4.11, 4.25
4.75, 1.88
```

#### Procedures for the solution of question No. 5

__1º step__ - Sort the data in ascending order.

```txt
1.00, 1.00, 1.20, 1.24, 1.25, 1.36
1.50, 1.62, 1.88, 2.00, 2.00, 2.16
2.15, 2.33, 2.50, 2.56, 2.59, 2.69
2.70, 2.80, 3.00, 3.20, 3.33, 3.40
4.00, 4.11, 4.12, 4.15, 4.15, 4.16
4.22, 4.25, 4.25, 4.26, 4.30, 4.30
4.36, 4.40, 4.50, 4.75, 4.89, 5.00
5.00, 5.20, 5.23, 5.32, 5.66, 5.69
5.89, 5.98
```

__2º step__ - To create a frequency distribution table, we need to find out the range for each class. The instruction left us free to choose the number of classes.

```txt
50 = number of total records in the data set
? = number of classes
```

- Sturges rule

```txt
k = number of classes
n = number of total records in the data set
k = 1 + 3.3 * log(n)
k = 1 + 3.3 * log(50)
k = 6.606
```

- Power of 2 rule

```txt
k = number of classes
n = number of total records in the data set
k = 2ᵏ ≥ n
k = 2⁶ = 64
k = 6
```

- Square root rule

```txt
k = number of classes
n = number of total records in the data set
k = √n
k = √50
k = 7.071
```

The ideal number of classes is __7__ and the interval between classes for the frequency distribution table is __0.72__.

knowing this, the frequency distribution table can now be built:

| Midpoint (x^) |   Yield (x)   | Absolute frequency (f) | Cumulative frequency (F) | Relative frequency % (fr) | Cumulative frequency % |

|      4.96     | 4.60\|---5.32 |            6           |            45            |             12            |           90           |

__3º step__ - Now that we've finished the table, we can plot the graph.

|    6 --- 8   |         6        |
|   8 --- 10   |         2        |

#### Solution of question No. 6

__1º step__ - Add information to the frequency distribution table.

| Midpoint | Weights (kg) | Simple frequency | Cumulative frequency | Relative frequency % | Cumulative frequency % |
|:--------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|

__2nd__ - Now we can affirme that more than 65% of the observations weigh 4 kg or more.  

__Answer__: Alternative __c__.

b) The above data are insufficient for the construction of a frequency polygon.  
c) The above data are insufficient for the construction of a graph of accumulated relative frequency.  
d) The increasing cumulative relative frequency of the second class interval is 0.25.  

#### Solution of question No. 7

__1º step__ - Add information to the frequency distribution table.

| Midpoint | Minimum wages (x) | Simple frequency | Cumulative frequency | Relative frequency % | Cumulative frequency % |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|
|     3    |      1 --- 5      |         5        |           5          |           5          |            5           |
