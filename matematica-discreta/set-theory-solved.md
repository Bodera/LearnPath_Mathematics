# Solving exercises

You may want to check out [this pdf file](./teoria-dos-conjuntos1.pdf) in order to read more about set theory and the needed properties to perform operations between them.

The __bold text__ will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using formulas. The *italic text* will be used to denote a problem which solution will be achieved using the [Venn diagram](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/venn-diagrams.html), in this case the [meta-chart tool](https://www.meta-chart.com/venn#/) will be used to plot the diagrams.

## Exercises

### Question No. 1

Being the sets:
```
  A = {0, 3, 7}
  B = {0, 3, 5}
```
Using the symbols ∈ and ∉, list:

a) (∈) 3 and A
b) (∉) 1 and B
c) (∈) 3 and B
d) (∈) 0 and A
e) (∉) 5 and A
f) (∈) 7 and A
g) (∉) 7 and B
h) (∉) 2 and B

### Question No. 2

Consider the sets
```
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1, 2, 3}
  C = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
  D = {3, 7}
```
Using the symbols ⊂ and ⊄, relate the sets to each other:

a) (⊂) A and B
b) (⊂) A and C
c) (⊄) A and D
d) (⊂) B and C
e) (⊄) D and A
f) (⊄) D and B
g) (⊂) D and C

### Question No. 3

In the diagram below, A, B and C are three non-empty sets. Check V or F for each of the sentences, depending on whether it is true or false:

a) ( ) A ⊂ C
b) ( ) B ⊂ C
c) ( ) C ⊂ A
d) ( ) A ⊂ B
e) ( ) C ⊄ A
f) ( ) A ⊄ B
g) ( ) C ⊃ A
h) ( ) A ⊅ C
i) ( ) B ⊃ C
j) ( ) C ⊂ B
