# Fractional numbers and numeric expressions

## Series No. I

Simplify:

I) 🠪 ⁸⁄₂₄  
II) 🠪 ²¹⁄₂₈  
III) 🠪 ³²⁄₄₀  
IV) 🠪 ⁴⁸⁄₈₄  

### Resolution for series no. I

```txt
gcd(8;24)

Factors of 8 = 2 ^ 3
Factors of 24 = 2 ^ 3 * 3

Thus gcd(8;24) = 2^3 = 8

8 ÷ 8 = 1
24 ÷ 8 = 3

⁸⁄₂₄ = ⅓
```

```txt
gcd(21;28)

Factors of 21 = 3 * 7
Factors of 28 = 2 ^ 2 * 7

Thus gcd(8;24) = 7

21 ÷ 7 = 3
28 ÷ 7 = 4

²¹⁄₂₈ = ¾
```

```txt
gcd(32;40)

Factors of 32 = 2 ^ 5
Factors of 40 = 2 ^ 3 * 5

Thus gcd(32;40) = 2 ^ 3 = 8

32 ÷ 8 = 4
40 ÷ 8 = 5

³²⁄₄₀ = ⅘
```

```txt
gcd(48;84)

Factors of 48 = 2 ^ 4 * 3
Factors of 84 = 2 ^ 2 * 3 * 7

Thus gcd(48;84) = 2 ^ 2 * 3 = 12

48 ÷ 12 = 4
84 ÷ 12 = 7

⁴⁸⁄₈₄ = ⁴⁄₇
```

## Series No. II

Write as a mixed fraction:

I) 🠪 ³¹⁄₅  
II) 🠪 ²⁴⁄₇  
III) 🠪 ²³⁄₅  
IV) 🠪 ⁴¹⁄₉  

### Resolution for series no. II

```txt
31 ÷ 5 = 6 with remainder of 1

Thus ³¹⁄₅ = 6⅕
```

```txt
24 ÷ 7 = 3 with remainder of 3

Thus ²⁴⁄₇ = 3³⁄₇
```

```txt
23 ÷ 5 = 4 with remainder of 3

Thus ²³⁄₅ = 4⅗
```

```txt
41 ÷ 9 = 4 with remainder of 5

Thus ⁴¹⁄₉ = 4⁵⁄₉
```

## Series No. III

Write as a fraction:

I) 🠪 3⅚  
II) 🠪 1⁴⁄₇  
III) 🠪 2⅓  
IV) 🠪 7½  

### Resolution for series no. III

```txt
3⅚  = (6 * 3 + 5) ÷ 6
    = 23 ÷ 6

Thus 3⅚ = ²³⁄₆
```

```txt
1⁴⁄₇ = (7 * 1 + 4) ÷ 7
    = 11 ÷ 7

Thus 1⁴⁄₇ = ¹¹⁄₇
```

```txt
2⅓  = (3 * 2 + 1) ÷ 3
    = 7 ÷ 3

Thus 2⅓ = ⁷⁄₃
```

```txt
7½  = (2 * 7 + 1) ÷ 2
    = 15 ÷ 2

Thus 7½ = ¹⁵⁄₂
```

## Series No. IV

Resolve:

I) 🠪 ⁷⁄₁₃ + ¹⁰⁄₁₃  
II) 🠪 ⁹⁄₁₁ + ¹⁰⁄₁₁  
III) 🠪 2⅕ + ⅖  
IV) 🠪 1³⁄₁₀ + 2⁹⁄₁₀  

### Resolution for series no. IV

```txt
⁷⁄₁₃ + ¹⁰⁄₁₃ =  ⁷⁺¹⁰⁄₁₃
            = ¹⁷⁄₁₃
            = 1⁴⁄₁₃

Thus ⁷⁄₁₃ + ¹⁰⁄₁₃ = 1⁴⁄₁₃
```

```txt
⁹⁄₁₁ + ¹⁰⁄₁₁ = ⁹⁺¹⁰⁄₁₁
            = ¹⁹⁄₁₁
            = 1⁸⁄₁₁

Thus ⁹⁄₁₁ + ¹⁰⁄₁₁ = 1⁸⁄₁₁
```

```txt
2⅕ + ⅖ = ¹¹⁄₅ + ⅖
       = ¹¹⁺²⁄₅
       = ¹³⁄₅
       = 2⅗

Thus 2⅕ + ⅖ = 2⅗
```

```txt
1³⁄₁₀ + 2⁹⁄₁₀ = ¹³⁄₁₀ + ²⁹⁄₁₀
             = ¹³⁺²⁹⁄₁₀
             = ⁴²⁄₁₀
             = 4²⁄₁₀

Thus 1³⁄₁₀ + 2⁹⁄₁₀ = 4²⁄₁₀
```

## Series No. V

Resolve:

I) 🠪 ⁸⁄₁₅ - ²⁄₁₅  
II) 🠪 ¹⁰⁄₃ - 2⅓  
III) 🠪 5⅙ - 2⅚  
IV) 🠪 2³⁄₇ - 1⅐
