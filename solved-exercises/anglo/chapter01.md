### Teaching practical algorithm

Given:

```txt
√140625
```

We start separating the radicate from right to left, in groups of two digits. The last group on the left may have only one digit. So we have:

```txt
√14.06.25
```

We move on searching for the exact square root, or with an approximation of one unit due to lack (that is, the root of the largest perfect square contained in that number), from the first group on the left, and we will then have the first digit of our answer.

Thus, for √14, 3 is taken (after all, the largest square contained in 14 is 9), and we indicate this number to the right of the radical, thus:

```txt
√14.06.25 | 3
```

Then we must subtract from the first group to the left of the radicate (in this case 14) the square of the first algarithm of the root (which is 3, then subtract by 9), after the operation we will obtain our first remainder which is 5, thus:

| 14 | 06 | 25 | \| | 3 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|
|  9 |    |    |    |   |
|  5 |    |    |    |   |

To the right of the first remainder (5) the second group (06) is lowered, from which we will separate the last digit to the right (6), thus:

| 14 | 06 | 25 | \| | 3 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|
|  9 |    |    |    |   |
| 50 |  6 |    |    |   |

Double the obtained root (the double of 3 is 6) and write it below the number (3). Like this:

| 14 | 06 | 25 | \| | 3 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|
|  9 |    |    |    | 6 |
| 50 |  6 |    |    |   |

Then the number formed by the group to the left of the rest (50) is divided by the double of the root found (3 * 2 = 6), and this quotient is written to the right of the double of the root and will be the second digit of the answer, or it may be that it is too large a number for our answer, thus:

| 14 |  06 | 25 | \| |    3   |     |
|:--:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:------:|:---:|
|  9 |     |    |    | 68 * 8 | 544 |
| 50 |  6  |    |    |        |     |
| 54 |  4  |    |    |        |     |
|    | -38 |    |    |        |     |

As expected the integer division of 50 by 6 results in 8, so when we write it to the right of the double of the root we have 68 and then multiply by the quotient finded (8), but the result is larger then our remainder (544 > 506).

If the product is less than or equal to the number formed by the remainder followed by the second group, the number will be exact, otherwise, it should be reduced by 1, 2, ... units, until the subtraction gives a non-negative difference. Let's try now with 7:

| 14 | 06 | 25 | \| |    3   |     |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:------:|:---:|
|  9 |    |    |    | 67 * 7 | 469 |
| 50 |  6 |    |    |        |     |
| 46 |  9 |    |    |        |     |
|    | 37 |    |    |        |     |

We found that 7 is the second digit of the answer.

To the right of the second remainder the third group is lowered and we separate the last digit. Like this:

| 14 |  06 | 25 | \| |   37   |     |
|:--:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:------:|:---:|
|  9 |     |    |    | 67 * 7 | 469 |
| 50 |  6  |    |    |        |     |
| 46 |  9  |    |    |        |     |
|    | 372 |  5 |    |        |     |

We must repeat the algorithm successively, until all groups of the radicate have been lowered. If there is no rest, the root will be exact; otherwise, the root will be approximated with an error of less than one unit per fault.

So now we do the integer division of 372 by 67 which results in 5. Then write it to the right of the double of the root (the double of 37 is 74) and calculate product.

| 14 |  06 | 25 | \| |   375   |      |
|:--:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:-------:|:----:|
|  9 |     |    |    |  67 * 7 |  469 |
| 50 |  6  |    |    | 745 * 5 | 3725 |
| 46 |  9  |    |    |         |      |
|    | 372 |  5 |    |         |      |
|    | 372 |  5 |    |         |      |
|    |     |  0 |    |         |      |

Therefore the square root of 140625 equals to 375.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES

- The square root of an integer will have as many digits as there are groups in the radicate.
- If after lowering a group and separating the last digit on the right, the resulting number on the left is less than twice the root, the digit in the root that corresponds to that group will be zero; the next group is lowered and the operation continues. Example below.

|  1 | 16 | 64 | \| | 1 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|
|  1 |    |    |    | 2 |
| 01 |  6 |    |    |   |

We have 1 < 2

|  1 | 16 | 64 | \| | 10 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  1 |    |    |    | 20 |
| 01 | 66 |  4 |    |    |

After adding up the zero we calculate the integer division of 166 by 20 which results in 8.

|  1 | 16 | 64 | \| |   108   |      |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-------:|------|
|  1 |    |    |    | 208 * 8 | 1664 |
| 01 | 66 |  4 |    |         |      |
| 1  | 66 | 4  |    |         |      |
|    |    | 0  |    |         |      |

Therefore the square root of 11664 equals to 108.
