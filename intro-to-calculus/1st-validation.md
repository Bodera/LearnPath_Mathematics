```txt
x = (-b ± √Δ) ÷ 2a
Δ = b² - 4ac
```

__2nd step__: Calculate the first equation.

```txt
x² - 2x  + 1 = 0
a = 1, b = -2, c = 1

Δ = (-2)² - 4*1*1
Δ = 4 - 4

x = (2 ± 0) ÷ 2
x = 1
```

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 4

__1st step__: Factor where possible.

```txt
(2^³⁄₂(4^⁵⁄₂))÷(8^⅔)
= (2^³⁄₂((2^2)^⁵⁄₂))÷((2^3)^⅔)
= (2^³⁄₂((2)^⁵⁄₂ * ²))÷((2)^(⅔ * ³))
= (2^³⁄₂(2^¹⁰⁄₂))÷(2^⁶⁄₃)
= (2^³⁄₂(2^5))÷(2²)
= (2^5)÷(2^(2 - ³⁄₂))
= (2^5)÷(2^½)
= 2^(5 - ½)
= 2^⁹⁄₂

2^⁹⁄₂
= 2⁴ * 2^½
= 16 * √2
```

__2nd step__: Answer the question.

The answer is `16 * √2`.

### Question No. 5

Calculate the simplified and factored expression of:

```txt
12(x + 3)⁵(x - 1)³ - 8(x + 3)⁶(x - 1)²
```

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 5

__1st step__: .

```txt

```

__2nd step__: Answer the question.

The answer is `4(x + 3)⁵(x - 1)²(x - 9)`.

The simplification of the expression given below corresponds to:

![Question No. 6 problem](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{3^{2n&plus;1}-9^{n}}{3^{2n}})

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 6

__1st step__: .

```txt
(3^(2n+1) - 9^n)÷(3^2n)
= (3^(2n+1) - (3²)^n)÷(3^2n)
= (3^(2n+1) - 3^2n)÷(3^2n)
= (3^(2n+1))÷(3^2n) - (3^2n)÷(3^2n)
= (3^(2n+1))÷(3^2n) - 1
= 3^(2n + 1 - 2n) - 1

__1st step__: Use the quadratic formula.

```txt
x = (-b ± √Δ) ÷ 2a
Δ = b² - 4ac
```
