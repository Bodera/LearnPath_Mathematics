### Question No. 1

The value of the expression below is?

```txt
(4⁷ * 4¹⁰ * 4)² ÷ (4⁵)⁷
```

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 1

__1st step__: Simplify amap (*as much as possible*).

```txt
(4⁷ * 4¹⁰ * 4)² ÷ (4⁵)⁷
= (4⁷⁺¹⁰⁺¹)² ÷ (4⁵)⁷
= (4¹⁸)² ÷ (4⁵)⁷
= 4¹⁸*² ÷ 4⁵*⁷
= 4³⁶ ÷ 4³⁵
= 4³⁶⁻³⁵
= 4¹
= 4
```

__2nd step__: Answer the question.

The answer is `4`.

### Question No. 2

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 2

__1st step__: Solve the parentheses first.

```txt
[(¹⁄₃ - ¹⁄₄) ÷ ⁷⁄₁₂ + ¹⁄₇ * (⁷⁄₂ - ⁵⁄₂)] * ¹⁄₂ ÷ ¹⁄₇
```
