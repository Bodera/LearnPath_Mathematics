### Question No. 1

Suppose that the total cost in brazilian reais to manufacture __n__ units of a certain product is given by the function C(n) represented below. Determine the manufacturing cost of 20 units.

```txt
C(n) = n³ - 30n² + 400n + 500
```

#### Procedures for solution of question No. 1

__1st step__: Replace n with 20.

```txt
C(20) = 20³ - 30 * 20² + 400 * 20 + 500
C(20) = 8000 - 30 * 400 + 8000 + 500
C(20) = 8000 - 12000 + 8500
C(20) = 16500 - 12000
C(20) = 4500
```

__2nd step__: Answer the question.

The manufacturing cost of 20 units is `R$ 4500.00`.
