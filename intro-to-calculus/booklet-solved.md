    -2           3
```

b)
```
-----(----------------------->
    -4                       +∞
```

#### Solution for question No. 1

a)
```
  -2 ≤ x < 3
```

b)
```
  x > -4
```

### Question No. 2

a) -3 ≤ x < 2  
b) -1 < x < 5  
c) x ≥ 1  
d) 2 ≥ x < 7  

#### Solution for question No. 2

a)

   -3              2
```

b)
```
----(--------------------)----
   -1                    5
```

           1               +∞
```

d)
```
--------[----------------)----
        2                7
```

### Question No. 3

Determine the distance between two real numbers:

a) 0 and 3  
b) -5 and -2  

#### Solution for question No. 3

a)
```
  3 - 0
  = 3 total distance.
```

b)
```
  (-2) - (-5)
  = 3 total distance
```

### Question No. 4

Determine the interval (s) constituted by the real numbers `x` that satisfy the given inequality:

a) |x - 3| ≤ 1
b) |2x + 1| > 3

#### Solution for question No. 4

a)
Developing solution:
```
= |x - 3| ≤ 1
= (x - 3) + 3 ≤ 1 + 3
= x - 3 + 3 ≤ 4
= x ≤ 4
or
= (x - 3) + 3 ≥ -1 + 3
= x - 3 + 3 ≥ 2
= x ≥ 2
```

Presenting solution:
```
S = {x ∈ ℝ | 2 ≤ x ≤ 4}
or
x ∈ [2, 4]
```

b)
Developing solution:
```
= |2x + 1| > 3
= (2x + 1) + (-1) < -3 + (-1)
= 2x + 1 - 1 < -3 - 1
= 2x < -4
= x < -2 
or
= (2x + 1) + (-1) > 3 + (-1)
= 2x + 1 - 1 > 3 - 1
= 2x > 2 
= x > 1 
```

Presenting solution:
```
S = {x ∈ ℝ | x < -2 or x > 1}
or
x ∈ (-∞, -2) ⋃ (1, ∞)
```
